# Leonardo-GPRS-GSM-IOT-Board-v1.0
Arduino Code to make working to send data to MQTT broker and Node-Red flow example to turn the on-board relay On/Off

The board is bought from Elecrow, as the link here : https://www.elecrow.com/leonardo-gprs-gsm-iot-board.html

This little neat board is very practical if you need to control things from remote using IOT way or traditional way (SMS).
Since i am more towards IOT implementer, here's the code for Arduino as well as Node-Red flow.

The library needed for this is the TinyGSM and PubSubClient (libraries are included here)
